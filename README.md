# Installation of NVIDIA CUDA on Fedora 23 Workstation (Linux)


Installation of NVIDIA’s [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) on a Fedora 23 Workstation was nontrivial; part of the reason is that it appears that *7.5* is the latest version of the CUDA Toolkit (as of 20150512), and 7.5 only supports (for sure) Fedora 21.  And, this 7.5 version supports (out of the box) C compiler gcc up to version `4.*` and not gcc 5.  But there’s no reason why the later versions, Fedora 23 as opposed to Fedora 21, gcc 5 vs. gcc `4.*`, cannot be used (because I got CUDA to work on my setup, including samples).  But I found that I had to make some nontrivial symbolic linking (`ln`).  

I wanted to install CUDA for Udacity’s [Intro to Parallel Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344), and in particular, in the very first lesson or video, [Intro to the Class](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344/lessons/55120467/concepts/658304810923), for instructions on running CUDA locally, only the links to the official NVIDIA documentation were given, in particular for Linux,   
http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux/index.html  
But one only needs to do a Google search and read some forum posts that installing CUDA, Windows, Mac, or Linux, is highly nontrivial.  

I’ll point out how I did it, and refer to the links that helped me (sometimes you simply follow, to the letter, the instructions there) and other links in which you should follow the instructions, but modify to suit your (my) system, and what *NOT* to do (from my experience).  

## Gist, short summary, steps to do (without full details), to just get CUDA to work (no graphics)

My install procedure assumes you are using the latest proprietary NVIDIA Accelerated Graphics Drivers for Linux.  I removed and/or blacklisted any other open-source versions of nvidia drivers, and in particular blacklisted nouveau.  See my [blog post](https://ernestyalumni.wordpress.com/#OhNoFedoraetNvidia) for details and description.  

* Download the latest [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (appears to be 7.5 as of 20160512).  For my setup, I clicked on the boxes Linux for Operation System, x86_64 for Architecture, Fedora for Distribution, 21 for Version (only one there), runfile (local) for Installer Type (it was the first option that appeared).  Then I modified the instructions on their webpage: 

	1. Run `sudo sh cuda_7.5.18_linux.run`
	2. Follow the command-line prompts.

Instead, I did

```
$ sudo sh cuda_7.5.18_linux.run --override
```
with the `- -override` flag to use gcc 5 so I **did not** have to downgrade to gcc `4.*`.  

Here is how I selected my options at the command-line prompts (and part of the result):

```
$ sudo sh cuda_7.5.18_linux.run --override

Again, Fedora 23 was not a supported configuration, but I wished to continue.  I had already installed NVIDIA Accelerated Graphics Driver for Linux (that’s how I was seeing my X graphical environment) but it was a later version **361.* ** and I did not want to uninstall it and then reinstall, which was recommended by other webpages (I had already gone through the [mini-nightmare of reinstalling these drivers before](https://ernestyalumni.wordpress.com/#OhNoFedoraetNvidia), which can trash your X11 environment that you depend on for a functioning GUI).  

* Continuing, this was also printed out by CUDA’s installer: 


Installing the CUDA Samples in /home/propdev/Public ...

Finished copying samples.

```
===========
= Summary =
===========

Driver:   Not Selected
Toolkit:  Installed in /usr/local/cuda-7.5
Samples:  Installed in /home/[yournamehere]/Public, but missing recommended libraries

Please make sure that
 -   PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin
 -   LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root

To uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstall script in /usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin
To uninstall the NVIDIA Driver, run nvidia-uninstall

Please see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf in /usr/local/cuda-7.5/doc/pdf for detailed information on setting up CUDA.

***WARNING: Incomplete installation! This installation did not install the CUDA Driver. A driver of version at least 352.00 is required for CUDA 7.5 functionality to work.
To install the driver using this installer, run the following command, replacing <CudaInstaller> with the name of this run file:
    sudo <CudaInstaller>.run -silent -driver

Logfile is /tmp/cuda_install_7123.log
```

For “ `PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-7.5` ” I do 
```
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin:$PATH
```
as suggested by Chapter 6 of [CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/docs/CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf)

Dealing with the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, I did this: I created a new text file (open up your favorite text editor) in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` called `cuda.conf`, e.g. I used emacs:
```
sudo emacs cuda.conf
```
and I pasted in the directory
```
/usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64
```
(since my setup is 64-bit) into this text file.  I did this because my `/etc/ld.so.conf` file includes files from `/etc/ld.so.conf.d`, i.e. it says
```
include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
```
Make sure this change for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is made by running the command
```
ldconfig
```
as root.  


I check the status of this “linking” to `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the `echo` command, each time I reboot, or log back in, or start a new Terminal window:
```
echo $PATH
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

* Patch the `host_config.h` header file

cf. [Install NVIDIA CUDA on Fedora 22 with gcc 5.1](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Install-NVIDIA-CUDA-on-Fedora-22-with-gcc-5-1-654/) and [CUDA incompatible with my gcc version](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6622454/cuda-incompatible-with-my-gcc-version)

To use gcc 5 instead of gcc `4.*`, I needed to patch the `host_config.h` header file because I kept receiving errors.  What worked for me was doing this to the file - original version:

```
#if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ > 9)

#error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 4.9 are not supported!

#endif /* __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ > 9) */
```

Commented-out version (these 3 lines)
```
// #if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ > 9)

// #error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 4.9 are not supported!

// #endif /* __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ > 9) */
```

Afterwards, I did not have any problems with c compiler gcc incompatibility (yet).  

* At this point CUDA runs without problems if no graphics capabilities are needed.  For instance, as a sanity check, I ran, from the installed samples with CUDA, I made `deviceQuery` and ran it:
```
$ cd ~/NVIDIA_CUDA-7.5_Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
$ make -j12
$ ./deviceQuery
```

And then if your output looks something like this, then **success!**

```
./deviceQuery Starting...

```

* Getting the other samples to run, getting CUDA to have graphics capabilities, soft symbolic linking to the existing libraries.

The flow or general procedure I ended up having to do was to use `locate` to find the relevant `*.so.*` or `*.h` file for the missing library or missing header, respectively, and then making soft symbolic links to them with the `ln -s` command.  I found that some of the samples have different configurations for in which directory the graphical libraries are (GL, GLU, X11, glut, etc.) than other samples in the samples included by NVIDIA.  


** Why do I see "nvcc: No such file or directory" when I try to build a CUDA application

"Your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable is not set up correctly. Ensure that your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes the lib and/or lib64 directory where you installed the Toolkit, usually `/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib{,64}`:" (replace 7.0 with whatever version you're on; mine is 7.5)
`
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_P
